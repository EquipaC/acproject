### Halfway



Project developed by a team of 5 during a 24 hour Hackathon as part of the 3rd and final project at <Academia de Código_>. 
For this particular Hackathon the Porto and Fundão campuses joined forces, and the teams were created with people from these two bootcamps. 



### The Idea
 


We began this project with a challenge: develop a product inspired by a song: "Livin' on a Prayer" by Bon Jovi. We were quick to reach our concept: an application that allows startups to display their projects so that prospective investors can fund them.



### Development



We divided our worktime into flexible sprints that were mostly 2 hours long.
