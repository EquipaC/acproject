### Halfway



A web application developed by a team of 5 during a 24 hour Hackathon as part of the 3rd and final project at <Academia de Código_> with the song "Livin' on a Prayer" as our theme.
For this particular Hackathon the Porto and Fundão campuses joined forces and the teams were created with people from these two bootcamps. 



### The Idea
 


We began this project with a challenge: develop a product inspired by a song by Bon Jovi. We were quick to reach our concept: an application that allows startups to display their projects so that prospective investors can fund them.



### Development



We divided our worktime into flexible sprints that were mostly 2 hours long. Depending on the needs at the time we adjusted the length of sprints to account for it.
Initially we brainstormed the basic concept and established our priorities for the first sprint. As the night went on we did meetings to stay on track and be aware of where everyone (and the project) was. Keeping with the Agile mindset we flowed from back to frontend to assure that our MVP would be reached.
